# **webrtc-ip**
ðŸ’» Gets a users public IP address in the browser. 
  

### NOTICE:
This script no longer gets users private IP addresses, due to security concerns originating with the teams at Google and Apple, but reliably gets public ones. For more information, please read [this](https://bloggeek.me/psa-mdns-and-local-ice-candidates-are-coming/) great article that explains all you need to know.

### Getting Started
If you are using this in the browser, include the following script in the `<head>` part of your HTML to access the `getIPs()` function:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeymalvinni/webrtc-ip/dist/production.min.js"></script>
<!---- OR use the dev bundle: ----->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeymalvinni/webrtc-ip/dist/bundle.dev.js"></script>
```
  
You now have access to the `getIPs()` function.
  

### Alternatives

If you don't want to include this as a script, you can run the code on the website like this:
```js
(async() => {
  eval(await (await fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joeymalvinni/webrtc-ip/dist/bundle.dev.js")).text());
  alert(await getIPs());
})()
```
Please note: this does not work on sites like Github where `unsafe-eval` is disabled.

### Usage
  
```js
// Using Promises:
getIPs().then(data=>{
  console.log(data.join('\n'))
})

// Using Async/Await:
(async function(){
  let data = await getIPs();
  console.log(data.join('\n'));
})();
```
